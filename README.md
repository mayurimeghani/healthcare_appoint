Get Appointments: GET /api/appointments

Get Appointment: GET /api/appointments/{id}

Create an Appointment: POST /api/appointments

Cancel an Appointment: POST /api/appointments/{id}/cancel

Note: Make sure to pass the Authorization header with a Bearer token for routes requiring authentication (for all routes except login and register).

# For more API information, check the collection file available in the documents branch. Import it in Postman.

8. Authentication

The application uses Sanctum for authentication.

Login: Send a POST request to /api/login with email and password.

Register: Send a POST request to /api/register with name, email, password, and password_confirmation.

Accessing Protected Routes: After login, youâ€™ll receive a token. You can pass the token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE


Use this token to authenticate protected routes like getting appointments, creating appointments, etc.
